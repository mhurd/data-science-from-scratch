# Control Flow
#
# As in most programming languages, you can perform an action conditionally using if:

if 1 > 2:
    message = "if only 1 were greater than two..."
elif 1 > 3:
    message = "elif stands for 'else if'"
else:
    message = "when all else fails use else (if you want to)"

# You can also write a ternary if-then-else on one line, which we will do occasionally:

x = 1
parity = "even" if x % 2 == 0 else "odd"

# Python has a while loop:

x = 0
while x < 10:
    print x, "is less than 10"
    x += 1

# although more often we'll use for and in:

for x in range(10):
    print x, "is less than 10"

#_ If you need more-complex logic, you can use continue and break:

for x in range(10):
    if x == 3:
        continue  # go immediately to the next iteration
    if x == 5:
        break     # quit the loop entirely
    print x

# This will print 0, 1, 2, and 4.
