# Sets
#
# Another data structure is set, which represents a collection of distinct elements:

s = set()
s.add(1)       # s is now { 1 }
s.add(2)       # s is now { 1, 2 }
s.add(2)       # s is still { 1, 2 }
x = len(s)     # equals 2
y = 2 in s     # equals True
z = 3 in s     # equals False

# We'll use sets for two main reasons. The first is that in is a very fast operation on sets.
# If we have a large collection of items that we want to use for a membership test, a set is
# more appropriate than a list:stopwords_list = ["a","an","at"] + hundreds_of_other_words + ["yet", "you"]

stopwords_list = ["foo"]
r1 = "zip" in stopwords_list     # False, but have to check every element
stopwords_set = set(stopwords_list)
r2 = "zip" in stopwords_set      # very fast to check

# The second reason is to find the distinct items in a collection:item_list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
item_list = ["foo"]
num_items = len(item_list)                # 6
item_set = set(item_list)                 # {1, 2, 3}
num_distinct_items = len(item_set)        # 3
distinct_item_list = list(item_set)       # [1, 2, 3]
